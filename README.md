# HR-Analytics-Challenge
Welcome to the HR Analytics project! In this project, we delve into the HR Analytics dataset to gain insights into employee-related metrics and trends. The dataset provides information about employee performance, satisfaction, and various other factors.HR analytics is revolutionising the way human resources departments operate, leading to higher efficiency and better results overall. Human resources has been using analytics for years. However, the collection, processing and analysis of data has been largely manual, and given the nature of human resources dynamics and HR KPIs, the approach has been constraining HR. Therefore, it is surprising that HR departments woke up to the utility of machine learning so late in the game. Here is an opportunity to try predictive analytics in identifying the employees most likely to get promoted.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to perform HR analytics and gain insights into employee satisfaction, performance, and factors influencing attrition. Potential analysis areas include:
* Identifying factors that contribute to employee satisfaction.
* Analyzing the correlation between the number of projects and employee performance.
* Predicting employee attrition and exploring factors influencing it.

  
## Dataset Overview
The HR Analytics dataset consists of the following key columns:

* satisfaction_level: Employee satisfaction level (ranging from 0 to 1).
* last_evaluation: Last performance evaluation score (ranging from 0 to 1).
* number_project: Number of projects assigned to the employee.
* average_montly_hours: Average monthly hours worked by the employee.
* time_spend_company: Number of years the employee has been with the company.
* Work_accident: Whether the employee has had a work accident (1 for yes, 0 for no).
* left: Whether the employee left the company (1 for yes, 0 for no).
* promotion_last_5years: Whether the employee was promoted in the last 5 years (1 for yes, 0 for no).
* sales: Department in which the employee works.
* salary: Salary level of the employee (low, medium, high).

  
## Analysis Steps
### Data Cleaning:
* Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
* Cleaned and standardized data types.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Explored the distribution of key features.
* Created visualizations to highlight trends and patterns.
### Employee Satisfaction Analysis:
* Analyzed factors influencing employee satisfaction.
* Explored the correlation between satisfaction and other metrics.
### Attrition Prediction Model:
* Developed a predictive model for employee attrition.
* Explored the impact of different features on attrition.
## Results
Detailed analysis results, visualizations, and insights can be found in the Jupyter notebook .

## Dependencies
Python 3.x
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Jupyter.
